Jailpkg
=======

Simple scripts for package management inside jails

Doesn't actually work yet, and is also an exercise in overengineering so that I
could learn some more idiomatic python testing and packaging.

But is also semi-useful because ansible's dict navigation is shit.

TODO
----
1. Make it actually work
2. Convert Makefile to tox for less virtualenv ridiculousness
